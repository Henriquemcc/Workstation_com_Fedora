# Workstation with Fedora

This is the installation script of the programs which I use in my computer on [Fedora](https://getfedora.org) operating
system (Linux Distribution)

## How to run

With Fedora installed on your machine, open the 'Terminal' and on it copy and paste the following command:

```
wget "https://github.com/Henriquemcc/Workstation_com_Fedora/archive/refs/heads/main.zip";unzip "main.zip";cd "Workstation_com_Fedora-main";bash "Executar.sh";
```
